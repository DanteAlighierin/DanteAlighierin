## Brief info
Hello to everyone who visited this page.
For me, programming is more of a hobby for me than a job. Although a couple of times I had to write code for money. So if you have a job, then contact me.

You can contact me by [telegram](https://t.me/dailymotions).


## Skills
What I own( I will also give examples of my best projects):

<strong>python</strong> 

- [SPWM](https://github.com/DanteAlighierin/SPWM) - simple window Manager for Xorg.
- [PyQr](https://github.com/DanteAlighierin/PyQr) - utility for generating qr codes. Presented in both cli and graphical mode.
- [TkMessenger](https://github.com/DanteAlighierin/TkMessenger) - lightweight p2p messenger with tkinter gui.

<strong>golang</strong> 
- [ftwa](https://github.com/DanteAlighierin/ftwa) - simple web application for file sharing.

<strong>bash</strong>
- [gitBackup](https://github.com/DanteAlighierin/gitBackup) - utility for creating a backup by cloning files to a remote server (service) via git.


## My site
I am most proud of my website - [Dante's blog](https://dantealighierin.github.io).
Sometimes I post articles there. I think that in the near future there will be even more articles.

## Linux and configs
Among other things, I am a Linux user with more than 3 years of experience.
I use Void Linux as a distribution, and swayWM as a window manager. I use about default configs a little tweaking to fit my needs. If someone needs a convenient working environment, you can use my configs without any problems.
